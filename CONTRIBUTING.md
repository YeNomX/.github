# Contributing

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing! :heart:

Contributions in any of the following ways are greatly appreciated and needed, but are not limited to:

- Code
  - Improve open source components
  - Help diagnose and report problems
  - Suggest fixes by sending patches
  - Help with missing documentation

- Graphic Design
  - Fine-tune or redesign some UI/icons

- Localization
  - Correct translation
  - Provide localization for more languages

When contributing to a repository, it is best to discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method before making it.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- Use SwiftLint to provide lint code for *.swift files. The [scripts-xcode](https://github.com/YeNomX/scripts-xcode) makes it easy to style your code during development.

Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/YeNomX/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.
